[WARNING]
====
By default, if a host entry that is associated with a virtual machine is deleted, the virtual machine will remain on the compute resource.

If you want {Project} to destroy virtual machines on the compute resource when the associated host entry is deleted, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Provisioning* and set the *Destroy associated VM on host delete* setting to *Yes*.

To avoid destroying virtual machines in this situation, disassociate the virtual machine from {Project} without removing it from the compute resource or keep the setting set to *No*.
