[WARNING]
====
By default, if a host entry that is associated with a virtual machine is deleted, the virtual machine will remain on the compute resource.

To delete the virtual machine on the compute resource when the associated host entry is deleted:

. Navigate to *Administer > Settings* and select the *Provisioning* tab.
. Change the *Destroy associated VM on host delete* setting to *Yes*.

To avoid deleting the virtual machine in this situation, disassociate the virtual machine from {Project} without removing it from the compute resource or change the setting to *No*.
